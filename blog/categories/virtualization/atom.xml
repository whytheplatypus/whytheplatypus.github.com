    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/58059557">Looks like VMWare support</a> is coming to <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> was mentioned on WeBWorK's devel list awhile back as a possiblilty for easy dev installs for our developers.  At the time I looked at it and decided against putting energy into it because I thought VitrualBox was kind of clunky (I have no argument or evidence to support that by the wayâ€¦) and the stand alone DMG we had worked well enough for a quick mac dev distro.<br/>
I've been using VMWare to play with SmartOS for awhile, I've also got a couple ubuntu WeBWorK installs on it, and I really like it so far.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is going to support it and, possibly even more exciting, <a href="http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html">cloud options</a> I think it could become an extreamly useful tool for WeBWorK developers and maybe even for the folks managing WeBWorK installs around the world.</p>

<p>It looks like these new features are set to land sometime in the middle of March, so I'll keep an eye on it and hopfull have some setups for WeBWorK soon after it's available.</p>
